#MIMIC-IV Healthcare Utilization Analytics

##Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full-stack data pipeline. I extracted clinical data from a **PostgreSQL** database, performed ETL and data engineering using SQL, and built a high-fidelity **Power BI** dashboard for hospital stakeholders.

##Data Architecture
- Source: MIMIC-IV Clinical Database.
- Engine: PostgreSQL (handling millions of records).
- Transformation: Created indexed Views in Postgres to optimize report performance (Query Folding).
- Frontend: Power BI with a custom "Medical-Modern" UI/UX.

##Tech Stack
- Database: PostgreSQL
- BI Tool: Power BI Desktop
- Query Language: SQL, DAX
- Design: Modern UI with custom background layouts

##Key Insights
- Identified a 15% increase in ICU stays for patients under 30 compared to previous years.
- Correlation found between specific 'Medical Conditions' and 'Average Billing Amount'.

## 📂 How to Reproduce
1. Run the scripts in `SQL_Scripts/` on your PostgreSQL instance.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in the `PBI_Report/` folder.
3. Change the 'Data Source Settings' to point to your local Postgres server.
