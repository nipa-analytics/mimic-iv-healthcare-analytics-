# 🏥 MIMIC-IV Healthcare Utilization Analytics

## 🚀 Executive Summary
This project demonstrates a production-style healthcare analytics solution built on the MIMIC-IV Clinical Database, with end-to-end data engineering, performance optimization, and executive dashboard design.

# The solution integrates:
1. PostgreSQL (millions of records)
2. Advanced SQL transformations
3. Optimized data modeling with Query Folding

## Executive-ready Power BI dashboard

Designed to simulate a real-world hospital analytics environment for operational and strategic decision-making.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture
- **Source:** MIMIC-IV
- **Engine:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Power BI

## 📊 Key Insights
- **15% increase** in ICU utilization
- Strong correlation between billing and condition

## Measured:
Average Length of Stay (LOS)
ICU Utilization Rate
Admissions per Patient
Demographic Distribution

## 📈 Core KPIs Delivered
Total Patients
Average Length of Stay
Average Admissions per Patient
ICU Utilization Rate
Admissions by Age Group
Gender Distribution Analysis

## ⚡ Performance Engineering Highlights
Created indexed SQL Views to reduce dashboard latency
Enabled Query Folding for efficient data pushdown
Optimized aggregations before loading into Power BI
Designed for scalability across millions of clinical records

##📂 How to Reproduce
Execute SQL scripts in /SQL_Scripts/ on your local PostgreSQL instance.
Import the optimized views into Power BI.
Open the .pbix file from /PBI_Report/.
Update Data Source Settings to connect to your PostgreSQL server.

Refresh and explore.
